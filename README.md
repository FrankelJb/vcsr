## Video Contact Sheets (in) Rust
A video contact sheet generator written in rust.

### Reasons for existing
This application is a direct port of [vcsi](https://github.com/amietn/vcsi). Full credit goes to the author for the algorithm and design.

I am learning Rust I while working on another project, I required a contact sheets generator. The existing generators needed some other tools during installation and I wanted something that I could just drop in and use. The process allowed me to focus on the language's ergonomics rather than the algorithm.
